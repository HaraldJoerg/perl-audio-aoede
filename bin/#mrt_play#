mrt_play - play a music roll text file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   $ mrt_play ../eg/entertainer.mrt

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program plays a file in L<Audio::Aoede::MusicRoll::Format|MRT format>.

=head1 CAVEATS

This program and the libraries providing the features have been
created as a side effect from some other work and turned out to be a
lot of fun.  They are far from mature, and the author frequently
refactors things, so absolutely I<nothing> is guaranteed.
