=head1 NAME

mrt_play - play a music roll text file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   $ mrt_play ../eg/entertainer.mrt

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program plays a file in L<Audio::Aoede::MusicRoll::Format|MRT format>.
The path to the file is given as a parameter.

=head1 CAVEATS

This program and the libraries providing the features have been
created as a side effect from some other work and turned out to be a
lot of fun.  They are far from mature, and the author frequently
refactors things, so absolutely I<nothing> is guaranteed.
The software is not supposed to be installed in its current state.
It can be cloned from its
L<https://github.com/HaraldJoerg/perl-audio-aoede|GitHub repository>
and the program be run from its C<bin> directory.

I will I<try> to keep the
L<Audio::Aoede::MusicRoll::Format|MRT format>
compatible, though, so that newer versions of the player can
play MRT files written for an older one.

=head1 ERRORS

If the MRT file can not be found, or contains stuff which can not be
parsed, the program exits with an error message.
