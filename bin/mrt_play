=head1 NAME

mrt_play - play a music roll text file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   $ mrt_play ../eg/entertainer.mrt [output_path]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program plays a file in L<Audio::Aoede::MusicRoll::Format|MRT format>.
The path to the file is given as a parameter.

=head1 PARAMETERS

The first parameter is the path to the MRT file to be played.

The second parameter is optional: If not given, then the output is
sent to the default audio device.  You can provide a path to an output
file here, then the audio output will be sent to that file.  The file
extension of the file must be recognizable by our backend (SoX) as an
audio format.

=head1 CAVEATS

This program and the libraries providing the features have been
created as a side effect from some other work and turned out to be a
lot of fun.  They are far from mature, and the author frequently
refactors things, so absolutely I<nothing> is guaranteed.
The software is not supposed to be installed in its current state.
It can be cloned from its
L<GitHub repository|https://github.com/HaraldJoerg/perl-audio-aoede>
and the program be run from its C<bin> directory.

I will I<try> to keep the
L<Audio::Aoede::MusicRoll::Format|MRT format>
compatible, though, so that newer versions of the player can
play MRT files written for an older one.

=head1 ERRORS

If the MRT file can not be found, or contains stuff which can not be
parsed, the program exits with an error message.
